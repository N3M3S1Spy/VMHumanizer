# VMHumanizer
VMHuminazor is a tool that transforms a plain virtual machine into a system that appears to be a regularly used, personal computer. It doesn't detect or evade virtualization â€” instead, it adds realistic user artifacts and activity traces to make the VM blend in as a genuine workstation.
